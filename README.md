# Robot-For-College-Security-Surveillance

A robot working with the help of Raspberry Pi microcontroller and code is written in the python language.

PatrollingRover_v_2_8.py : #This is the main file which contains all the code together.#
The file contains the code for the movement of the robot and sensing distance using the ultasonic sensor as well as the code for temperature and humidity. In this we have connected the gmail account, the captured image will send to the mail which is regitered.

Fire.py : The file contains the code for sending the DHT11 sensor data to firebase.

Live_Video_streaming.py : This python file contains the code for the live streaming of the surrounding by using the pi camera.

In this project we have used the firebase database for real time data storage for that we have developed the code.
a.by: Contains a code for motors
b.py: Containing a code for temperature and humidity sensor data for storing on firebase.
c.py contains a code for ultrasonic sensor for measuring the distance of an object.
